# supervisely-to-yolo
Converts Supervisely export project to Darknet Yolo compatible training data set.

Supervisely is a platform designed for data annotation. Annotated data can be
exported but Supervisely does not support Yolo data set export model. This
Python script will convert Supervisely exported project to Darknet Yolo training
data set. All you need to do is start training using the generated data set. :)
